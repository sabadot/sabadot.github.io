        <p>Organizing &amp; Creating a Resource Hub</p>
        <p class="lightF topbar">One of the projects I was tasked with in my internship with the interior design company Room Edit was to edit tutorial module videos created for the onboarding process of new designers. Editing the videos themselves is a simple task. However, there was an opportunity to present the videos in a cohesive manner that identifies these as "the Room Edit process". From the start I knew there were going to be multiple videos and imagining them as a set, I proposed an idea to create title and end slates. It's a simple idea, but they make a lovely frame for each video. From that, I was asked to expand the scope of the project and create an online hub that designers can navigate to access the module videos. This required me to learn web design on the Squarespace platform, and create icons to represent each video under a Modules section. More functions were added to the Hub as I worked with my director, LuAnne Howard, on the videos. I needed icons for some document download links under a Guides section and for vendor categories after organizing our vendor list. As the content would suggest, this goes under the Vendors section. I also created links to our Pinterest boards which needed named buttons. Lastly, we arranged to make a Meet the Team page, acquiring consistent headshots and bios for each designer on the Room Edit team.
