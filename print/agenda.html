        <p>project description</p>
        <p class="lightF">This was a project I volunteered to do with a partner for my high school after graduating. I took care of the typography and the design of the daily planner pages, while my partner dicided on the aesthetic direction and applied it to charts and diagrams like the calendars. When I look back at it as a piece of design, I can criticize it and point out all the typographic mistakes, this project is important as my first work experience for a client, being the principal. I have had to work alongside communictions back and forth. This included explaining my design decisions, giving updates on work progress, and negotiating on resonable amendments and adding additional contents. The biggest challenge of this project was to add appoximately 15 new pages of information while maintaining the page number from the previous year. We surprisingly managed to accomplish what the principal wanted which we're proud of!</p>
