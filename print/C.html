        <p>project description</p>
        <p class="lightF">This short book is a producct of a typography course in my second year. I struggled in this course and that meant I learned lot from it. I struggle with coming up with compelling aesthetics which is something I'm actively trying to improve today. With this project, I asked my professor for help and what I learned was to be meticulous about my typography. By being transparent and letting go of my pride to ask for help, I was able to learn about many tiny typographic treatments that add towards the whole reading exerience. My professor treated me with respect and helped me by showing me how quality doesn't necessarily come from one strong concept, but from smaller details that I as the designer must care about.</p>
