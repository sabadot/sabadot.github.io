            <p class="lightF squeeze">My name is Tristan Sabado. I graduated from York/Sheridan Program in Design in 2022. I am a graphic designer living in Toronto who is enraptured by ideas and stories that other people want to share. I am the type of person who likes to listen to what people have to say when they care about what they are sharing. Each person lives a different life and there is so much to learn by listening to their experience. Design is the means I have to engage with people and do something with ideas and stories I have interest with. To me, being a platform for others to communicate and share is something I feel accomplished with and want to keep experiencing as I develop my skills as a designer. Among a broad range of skills, I have a particular interest in motion design and editorial design. Breaking down concepts and communicating messages in these longer form mediums is fun to work with and put together through a process of research, iteration and discussion. So far, my job experience includes working at the interior design start up company Room Edit as their full time video editor and graphic designer for three months as an internship.</p>
